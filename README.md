# Clustering project
Simple project focused on cluster analysis for an introductory Machine Learning class at Bocconi University.

## Task description
Find an optimal clustering of the data using the k-Means algorithm (implemented by sklearn.cluster.KMeans). This includes finding the best number of clusters. You need to decide whether or not to scale the data (consider using the sklearn function preprocessing.minmax_scale), whether or not to perform PCA, and in which order to perform these operations, the optimal parameters for the algorithm etc. Once you have found your optimal settings, make sure that they are specified in the conclusions of your notebook, and also print the cluster label of each point in a file.
